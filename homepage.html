                <p>Collected over the years for a variety of reasons, the Library's annotated books
                    today provide evidence not only for historians of reading but also for anyone
                    interested in how and why the mentalité of an era was formed. To forward the
                    progress of such historians, the Library is offering fully scanned renderings of
                    several of its most important annotated books. This gathering includes those
                    annotated by Gabriel Harvey, c. 1545 - 1630, friend of Edmund Spenser, and a
                    noted Elizabethan scholar. The Library's scans serve not only the immediate
                    purposes of the Princeton University Digital Library. They also serve as part of
                    larger collaborative digital projects. One such joint project in progress is <a

                <p>In 1824, the Vatican Library purchased the remarkable private book collection of
                    Count Leopoldo Cicognara (1767-1834), an Italian art historian and critic. The
                    roughly six thousand fifteenth through early-nineteenth century imprints, still
                    held by the Vatican as the Fondo Cicognara, comprise the foundational literature
                    of art and archaeology. The inventory of Count Leopoldo’s library, published in
                    1821 as the Catalogo ragionato dei libri d’arte e d’antichità, has been
                    reprinted many times and remains an essential tool for scholars and
                    bibliophiles. Princeton is gradually digitizing all of the more than 1,800
                    editions in its collection that match those in the Fondo Cicognara.</p>

                <p>The ephemeral collection of very rare 30 block prints fall into several
                    categories: some are color prints with a minimum of text, others are black and
                    white illustrated sheets, some of which include current news, while others have
                    a more general content. The news sheets were issued in Shanghai , when news of
                    the 1911 Revolution in Wuhan was telegraphed to print agencies in Shanghai. The
                    latter immediately printed illustrated sheets for a Chinese public avid for the
                    latest news; the illustrations themselves may therefore be based upon artists
                    imagination. The sheets generally support the Revolution as a modernizing party,
                    and hence some demonization of the enemy occurs in the prints, as was usual for
                    propaganda prints of that and earlier periods. The collection is useful for
                    investigations into the visual portrayal of the struggle of Han Chinese versus
                    the Manchus during the 1911 overthrow of the Qing Empire. Issues of "modernity"
                    and "nation" are easily visible in the prints. The collection also includes one
                    Japanese block print dating from 1914. The collection was given in 1937 to
                    Princeton Library by Donald Roberts, class of 1909, who was an Episcopalian
                    minister who taught history at St. John's University in Shanghai from 1915 to
                    1950. Comparison with earlier Chinese anti-Christian, or Japanese anti-Chinese
                    or anti-Russian prints made during the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars may
                    be instructive. The Princeton East Asian Library in no way supports the rhetoric
                    or depictions that are presented on the prints.</p>

                <p>This is a digital showcase of Chinese materials held at the Cotsen Children’s
                    Library, a major research collection of children's books and educational
                    materials from around the world. As of 2014, Cotsen has collected fourteen
                    thousand titles of Chinese-language materials that reflect the history of
                    childhood, children's entertainment, and education in China. The majority of the
                    Chinese titles were published from the late nineteenth century through the
                    twentieth century. Primers, textbooks, children's books, magazines, newspapers,
                    comic books (lianhuanhua), arts and crafts handbooks, political posters, wall
                    charts and slides for the school classroom, educational journals, cigarette
                    cards, and calendars are all part of the library's Chinese collection. Titles
                    that are highlighted here have been chosen in order to serve the teaching needs
                    at Princeton University and cater to research interests.</p>

                <p>The Guatemala News and Information Bureau (GNIB) was an activist and solidarity
                    group based in San Francisco, California, created in 1978 to support and inform
                    the public about Guatemalan movements for peace and justice, indigenous rights,
                    and labor rights. To support its activities, the GNIB systematically collected a
                    wide variety of materials documenting all aspects related to the civil war in
                    that country, including human rights abuses and the social and political
                    responses to state sponsored violence. Also documented were the negotiations and
                    the implementation of the Peace Accords signed in the mid 1990s. The result was
                    an unparalleled archive of gray literature (published and unpublished documents,
                    pronouncements, action alerts, press releases, flyers, newsclippings,
                    correspondence, and other types of ephemeral material), serials, and policy
                    reports representing the actions and views of activist groups, government
                    officers and politicians, journalists, international solidarity groups, as well
                    as revolutionary organizations. The Princeton University Library digitized over
                    11,000 items from the archive in collaboration with the Cooperative Digitization
                    of International Research Materials (CDIRM) project, organized by the Council of
                    American Overseas Research Centers (CAORC).</p>

                <p>Columbus’s description of his first voyage first appeared in print in a Spanish
                    edition published in Barcelona in 1493. Within four years it had gone through
                    fifteen known editions, including seven Latin editions, one German edition, a
                    paraphrase in Italian verse in five editions, and a second Spanish edition,
                    Valladolid, about 1497. These fifteen different editions were products of
                    presses scattered in ten cities across Europe. Of these fifteen editions, there
                    is at Princeton an exemplar for three of the seven Latin editions and an
                    exemplar of the German edition. The most direct manner of listing these is the
                    number assigned in F.R. Goff, Incunabula in American Libraries (1964): • C-758.
                    Latin. [Rome: Stephan Plannck, after 29 April 1493]. Cyrus McCormick copy,
                    presented to PUL. • C-759. Latin. Rome: Eucharius Silber, [after 29 April] 1493.
                    Grenville Kane copy, acquired by PUL and the Scheide Library copy • V-125.
                    Latin. [Basel:] I.B. [Johann Bergmann, de Olpe] 1494. Grenville Kane copy,
                    acquired by PUL. • C-762. German. Strassburg: Bartholomaeus Kistler, 30 Sept.
                    1497. Grenville Kane copy, acquired by PUL. REFERENCE: W. Eames, "Columbus'
                    Letter on the Discovery of America (1493-1497)" in the Bulletin of the New York
                    Public Library, 1924, 28:597-599. (NB: Eames lists seventeen editions; however,
                    the number is actually fifteen because Eames was unaware that three issued by
                    Marchant in Paris were variants of one edition.)</p>

                <p>Beginning with the industrial revolution in Great Britain, engineering objects
                    and systems have shaped our modern world. The works included in this collection
                    support the teaching and research conducted by students enrolled in the course
                    Engineering in the Modern World. In addition to exploring the impact of
                    engineering on shaping the modern world, the course also puts emphasis on the
                    scientific, political, ethical, and aesthetic aspects in the evolution of
                    engineering over the past two centuries. The collection highlights selected
                    structural engineering works: the St. Louis Bridge, the Bayonne Bridge and a
                    wide range of structures by Thomas Telford. Along with many other innovations,
                    these provide a base for studying how engineering advances helped shape the
                    modern society and culture.</p>

                <p>The British artist, James Gillray (1756-1815), was the leading force in what has
                    become known as the golden age of British caricature, approximately 1770 to
                    1820. Gillray chronicled and ridiculed the politicians and ruling class of his
                    day, in spectacularly hand-colored prints. This graphic arts collection includes
                    nearly 335 prints, all given by Dickson Q. Brown, class of 1895.</p>

                <p>Bruce Willsie, class of 1986, donated this collection of 155 engravings from the
                    Geschichtsblätter (History Sheets) published between 1570 and 1610 by the
                    Cologne printmakers and publishers Franz Hogenberg and his son Abraham. The
                    theme is the Eighty Years War (1568–1648), also known as the Dutch Revolt.
                    During this period, the northern provinces of the Habsburg Netherlands broke
                    free from Spanish rule to form the Dutch Republic while the Spanish Crown
                    maintained its hold on the southern provinces of Flanders and Brabant. The
                    Eighty Years War was far more than a merely regional event and its last three
                    decades coincided with the Thirty Years War. It was also entwined with the
                    Religious Wars in France and dynastic disputes in England that were partly
                    fought out on Netherlandish battlegrounds. The third sub-series of the
                    Geschichtsblätter, for example, depicts events of the French Religious Wars
                    (1559–1573) while the fourth series shows events in France as well as in
                    England.</p>

                <p>The James S. Hall Collection of George Frideric Handel provides rich
                    documentation of the history of performing the music of George Frideric Handel
                    (1685–1759), including manuscripts copied during Handel’s lifetime, performance
                    materials originating in the decades following Handel’s death, documents of
                    19th-century commemorative festivals in England, and extensive memorabilia from
                    the early years of the Handel Festival in Halle, Germany. Additionally, the
                    collection includes notes, drafts, and correspondence with scholars and
                    performers regarding performance practice issues, especially ornamentation. The
                    collection is a valuable commentary on the continuing popularity of Handel's
                    creative legacy and the remarkable ability of his music to be adapted to
                    changing aesthetic tastes and performance conditions.</p>

                <p>This collection is a digital showcase of Japanese prints and drawings held at the
                    Cotsen Children’s Library. Spanning from the Edo Period (1600-1868) to the first
                    half of the twentieth century, this collection contains hand-painted scrolls,
                    game boards (sugoroku), woodblock prints, pictorial maps, classroom wall charts,
                    and playing cards (iroha karuta). The game boards were selected from a total of
                    around 300 sheets of sugoroku held at Cotsen, a rare collection comparable to
                    the few existing in Japan. A dice-based game, sugoroku has entertained the
                    Japanese for centuries. A wide range of topics and themes can be found in the
                    heavily illustrated game boards, which served not only for recreation but also
                    for the dissemination of information, commercial advertising, literacy
                    education, moral and political socialization, and militarist propaganda
                    targeting children and adults alike.</p>

                    most important art forms. It was in these heavily illustrated volumes that some
                    of the most famous woodblock print artists of the day began their careers,
                    experimenting with the compositions, color, and printing techniques that we find

                <p>In 1739, the British artist John Baptist Jackson conceived of a book reproducing
                    seventeen of the great Venetian paintings by Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese,
                    Leandro da Ponte Bassano, Jacopo Bassano, and Francesco da Ponte Bassano. Titled
                    Titiani Vecelii, Pauli Galiarii, Jacobi Robusti et Jacobi de Ponte opera
                    selectiora, Jackson’s book is now considered a monument in eighteenth-century
                    printing. Jackson revived the complex Renaissance printing technique of dividing
                    the design between several blocks, each printed in a different color, to give
                    the image depth and dimension. His friend and fellow expatriate, Joseph Smith,
                    printed and published the twenty-four chiaroscuro plates under his imprint
                    Pasquali Press.</p>

                <p>Austrian-born Jean-Charles Krafft (1764-1833) is remembered for his detailed
                    documentation of “the most elegant” French neoclassical buildings. Krafft
                    verified particulars through correspondence with architects and on-site
                    drawings. Each building is shown to scale in elevation, plan and section.

                <p>The posters included in this collection were created by a wide variety of social
                    activists, non-governmental organizations, government agencies, political
                    parties, and other types of organizations across Latin America, in order to
                    publicize their views, positions, agendas, policies, events, and services. Even
                    though posters produced in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, and
                    Venezuela are the most abundant among the more than two thousand currently
                    available in the site, almost every country in the region is represented. In
                    terms of topics, some of the best represented are human rights, elections,
                    gender issues, indigenous issues, labor, ecology and environmental issues,
                    development, public health, and education. The Latin American Posters Collection
                    is a component of the larger collection of Latin American ephemera that
                    Princeton University Library has developed since the 1970s.</p>

                <p>McLoughlin Bros. was one of the most prominent publishers in the world of
                    children’s publications from the mid-nineteenth-century through the
                    mid-twentieth century. They are also considered to be one of the significant
                    American publishers in terms of sustained technical and marketing innovations
                    during this important era in publishing history. McLoughlin Bros. publisher’s
                    catalogs and marketing materials provide important research tools for those
                    interested in the history of children’s book publishing and the business and
                    marketing activity of a major American publisher. Dating McLoughlin Bros. titles
                    is notoriously difficult. Many McLoughlin books are undated; titles were also
                    reissued over and over again, often with changed inventory numbers from one
                    time-period to the next, keying revisions and different issue dates. Publisher’s
                    catalogs are the only source for identifying and itemizing the company’s
                    changing inventory numbers and revisions of exiting titles, as the firm
                    constantly revised and expanded its product lines of books and children’s’ toys.
                    The Cotsen Children’s Library holds one of the largest aggregations of
                    McLoughlin Brothers’ catalogs, many from the firm’s own business office and
                    publisher’s archive, uniquely annotated with information about new editions,
                    changes in illustrations, or new series. In addition, Cotsen holds ten large
                    scrap-book-style “guard-books” containing proof copies of illustrations for
                    books, many extensively hand-annotated by McLoughlin Bros. editorial or
                    production staff.</p>

                <p>Princeton University Library’s Arabic Movie Posters and Lobby Cards Collection
                    was acquired in 2008 from a Lebanese collector, Abdelmassih Abou-Jaoudeh of
                    al-Furat Publishing and is comprised of 1,748 posters and 768 lobby cards.
                    Egyptian posters predominate with 1,474, reflecting the unchallenged prominence
                    of Egypt in the production of Arabic feature films. Some 150 posters are for
                    Lebanese films, 113 Syrian and 11 Iraqi. The purpose of the posters was to
                    advertize coming attractions, and they represent films produced from 1935 to
                    2007. Most of the posters are on standard Arab single-sheet size paper. However,
                    many are on non-standard sheets. Similarly, there are posters that are composed
                    on multiple sheets, including some on twenty-four sheets meant for display on
                    the side of multi-story buildings. The lobbies cards, also for coming
                    attractions and meant for display in theater lobbies, are composed of multiple
                    still shots taken on movie sets and affixed to standard–sized cardboard. They
                    represent 172 films produced in Egypt (145), Lebanon (13) and Syria (14) from
                    1964 to 2007.</p>

                <p>Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) is generally considered one of Germany’s greatest
                    writers and philosophers. His controversial philosophical works provide a
                    revolutionary challenge to Christianity and traditional morality. He is perhaps
                    best known for his declaration of the death of God and his concepts of the
                    Übermensch and the Will to Power. His works have influenced countless
                    philosophers, writers, and artists since his death. The Friedrich Nietzsche
                    First Editions collection includes the first edition of all Nietzsche’s
                    published works in their original wrappers, from his early philological essays
                    in the journal Rheinisches Museum fur Philologie to the posthumously published
                    Ecce Homo. The only other known complete collection in original wrappers is in
                    the Nietzsche Haus Museum in Sils Maria, Switzerland. The collection was a 2001
                    gift from Professor Alexander Nehamas with funds provided by his Distinguished
                    Achievement in the Humanities Award from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</p>

                <p>As a result of generous support from the David A. Gardner '69 Magic Project, the
                    Princeton University Library created Voyager cataloging records for most of the
                    approximately 9,500 Islamic manuscripts in the Manuscripts Division, which are
                    from Robert Garrett (Class of 1897) and other sources. This is the premier
                    collection of Arabic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish, and other Islamic manuscripts in
                    the Western Hemisphere. Initially, more than 200 of these manuscripts were
                    digitized as the core of the Princeton Digital Library of Islamic Manuscripts.
                    Separate support from the the Virginia and Richard Stewart Memorial Fund,
                    through the Princeton University Council of the Humanities, has supported
                    digitization of an additional 1,400 other Islamic manuscripts from existing
                    black-and-white microfilm, produced in the 1970s with funding from the U.S.
                    Department of Education, Title II-C. The manuscripts digitized from microfilm
                    include all texts (chiefly New Series) on Shia law and theology; texts related
                    to other non-Sunni sects, such as the Druze and Kharijites; and more than 750
                    other manuscripts (Garrett Yahuda Series) on a variety of subjects. Also added
                    are PDFs of Islamic manuscripts digitized in response to photoduplication
                    requests. In all, approximately a sixth of the Library's Islamic manuscripts
                    have now been digitized and put online for the benefit of scholars
                    worldwide.</p>

                    from 1901 to 1922 through the Graeco-Roman Branch of the Egypt Exploration
                    Society, but the bulk of Princeton's papyri were acquired in the 1920s, either
                    directly or indirectly through the British Museum. Many were received from 1921
                    to 1928 through Princeton's participation in a five-member consortium that
                    included Princeton and other universities (Columbia, Cornell, Michigan,
                    University of California at Berkeley, the University of Geneva). Robert Garrett
                    (1875-1961), Class of 1897, partially underwrote Princeton's purchases. and then
                    between 1924 and 1930 independently purchased approximately 750 Egyptian papyri
                    through the British Museum for his own manuscript collection, which was first
                    deposited in the Library for scholarly use and publication, then formally
                    donated in 1942 with the rest of the Garrett Collection. There are more than a
                    thousand pieces in Princeton's collections. Best known are Princeton's literary,
                    early Christian, and sub-literary papyri. Among authors represented are
                    Aristophanes, Demosthenes, Euripides, Herodotus, Hippocrates, Homer, Isocrates,
                    Theocritus, and Xenophon. But a much larger number are Greek documentary papyri,
                    including census and tax registers, military lists, land convey¬ances, business
                    records, petitions, private letters, and other sources of historical and
                    paleographic interest from Ptolemaic (332-30 BCE), Roman (30 BCE-300 CE), and
                    Byzantine Egypt (300-650 CE). Nearly all were discovered from the 1890s to the
                    1920s, buried or recovered from mummy cartonnage in and around the ancient
                    Egyptian town of Oxyrhynchus and the Fayum towns. The Princeton collections also
                    include papyri in Egyptian languages (Hieroglyphic, Hieratic, Demotic, and
                    Coptic); Arabic papyri from the Islamic period (from 640 CE); and a smaller
                    number of Latin papyri from Roman Egypt and Ravenna.</p>

                <p>The 2013 Moscow mayoral election was in many ways a barometer for a particular
                    moment in the volatile balance between a longstanding authoritarian federal
                    regime and opposition forces in Russia’s capital, a barometer for the attitudes
                    and reactions of a new urban middle class bristling under authoritarian rule. It
                    stood as an index of the extent to which that class held and was willing to
                    mobilize political capital, and the extent to which the larger population in
                    Moscow was prepared to mount and support opposition to the regime. In 2013
                    Alexei Navalny, a Moscow mayoral candidate openly hostile to the Kremlin,
                    managed to run and to become the most serious challenger of the Kremlin-backed
                    incumbent Sergei Sobyanin. There had long been a general perception that
                    high-ranking elected municipal officials, and particularly those in the more
                    populous urban centers, were de facto Kremlin installations who ran in the
                    absence of any serious contest. Alexei Navalny had been a participant of some
                    notoriety in the groundswell of protest and opposition which was set in motion
                    following the State Duma Elections in 2011 and surged after the Presidential
                    Election of 2012, and in 2013 he decided to run as a mayoral candidate in
                    Moscow. He was ultimately not able to unseat the Kremlin-backed incumbent and
                    thwart the Kremlin's larger political objective for the 2013 Moscow mayoral
                    election. He did, however, receive financial backing from representatives of
                    Moscow's new monied professional and entrepreneurial classes and succeeded in
                    waging a vigorous and visible campaign and posing a significant challenge to the
                    incumbent. That a rogue candidate was able to achieve this in Russia's federal
                    administrative capital and most populous city was seen by many as evidence that
                    the Kremlin was no longer able to maintain its monopoly on political power.
                    After declaring his candidacy Navalny was arrested and briefly imprisoned on
                    what many saw as dubious charges, but his release less than 24 hours later was
                    widely registered as a sea-change in Russian politics - a sign that the rogue
                    candidate Navalny had managed to garner enough visibility and popular support to
                    make his imprisonment politically inexpedient for the Kremlin, had succeeded in
                    embarrassing the administration, forcing its hand and posing a formidable
                    challenge to its chosen candidate for the Moscow mayoral seat. This collection
                    contains just over 180 pieces of print ephemera documenting the verbal and
                    graphic languages deployed in the propaganda struggle that accompanied the 2013
                    Moscow mayoral contest.</p>

                <p>In 1966, collector and Francophile John Douglas Gordon, class of 1905, donated a
                    collection of 134 engravings by Robert Nanteuil (1623-1678) to Firestone
                    Library's Graphic Arts collection in memory of his wife, Janet Munday Gordon.
                    Nanteuil was Royal Engraver to Louis XIV and the outstanding portraitist of his

                <p>In 1928, the British caricature collector Dickson Q. Brown, Princeton Class of
                    1895, donated several thousand prints, drawings, and illustrated books to
                    Princeton University Library. He continued to augment this collection until his
                    death in 1939. The largest group was by Thomas Rowlandson (ca. 1756-1827)
                    including 685 prints and 62 original drawings, many never before published.
                    Additional gifts from Brown can be found in the James Gillray prints also
                    digitized on this site.</p>

                <p>This digital collection represents imprints from the Russian holdings of the
                    Cotsen Children’s Library. All of the selections in this group were produced
                    between 1918 and 1938 and present examples of the visual and verbal idioms
                    artists and authors used to address the country’s children and youth in the
                    first two decades after the October Revolution. They display a range of visual
                    and verbal efforts to represent the tumultuous first 2 decades of the Twentieth
                    Century in Russia and their culmination in the cataclysmic events of 1917, as
                    well as to communicate ideological orientation and inculcate the values of a new
                    society that was itself still at an early developmental stage. In terms of
                    technique, the selections feature verse and prose aimed at readers ranging from
                    early childhood to mid adolescence, as well as paint, drawing, photomontage,
                    and, in a few cases, the kind of creative typography characteristic of early
                    Twentieth-Century Russian avant-garde writers and artists such as Ilya Zdanevich
                    and Velimir Khlebnikov. Examples of fanciful or experimental formats in this
                    collection include the elaborate fold-out book Пятилетка (“Five-year plan”) and
                    a “Книжка-киносеанс” (“book-movie”) – a book that includes instructions for its
                    own deconstruction and reassembly as a film and building a makeshift projector
                    for its display. These 46 books - which include work by the artist Vladimir
                    Lebedev, Soviet children’s poet Agniya Barto, and poets Aleksandr Bezymenskii,
                    Vladimir Mayakovsky and Daniil Kharms - were chosen as particularly interesting
                    and/or representative specimens from the Cotsen collection’s holdings of almost
                    1,000 Russian children’s books published between the 1917 Revolution and the
                    beginning of WWII. The Cotsen’s Russian holdings total over 1,800 titles with
                    imprint dates from the mid-Seventeenth Century to the present.</p>

                <p>The Taller de Gráfica Popular (known as TGP) was founded 1937 by the talented
                    Mexican artists Leopoldo Méndez, Luis Arenal, and Pablo O'Higgins. The TGP
                    became the first self-supporting art workshop in Mexico to create and publish
                    their own work. Their work had a variety of objectives; some overtly political,
                    some comic, and some artistic. The Princeton University Library has collected
                    TGP prints by Alberto Beltrán, José Chávez Morado, Francisco Mora, Rufino
                    Tamayo, and Alfredo Zalce, among others.</p>

                <p>The Sid Lapidus '59 Collection on Liberty and the American Revolution features
                    more than 150 recently gifted important books, pamphlets and prints representing
                    the major themes of Lapidus' collecting: the intellectual origins of the
                    American Revolution; the Revolution itself; the early years of the republic; the
                    resulting spread of democratic ideas in the Atlantic world; and the effort to
                    abolish the slave trade in both Great Britain and the United States. On the
                    occasion of the gift in 2009, the Library published an illustrated color-printed
                    200 page catalogue, the main portions of which are now available as PDF files

                <p>The German American artist Thomas Nast (1840-1902) has been called the Father of
                    American Caricature. His political cartoons for such periodicals as Harper's
                    Weekly brought a halt to New York City's corrupt government under Boss Tweed,
                    helped elect Abraham Lincoln, and led to social reform throughout the country.
                    The Graphic Arts collection holds over 600 of Nast's original drawings and
                    published wood engravings from the 1850s to the 1890s. Several prints depict
                    Nast's image of the modern Santa Claus, for which he is most famous.</p>

                <p>The Scheide Library, received by Princeton University in 2015 as the bequest of
                    William H. Scheide (Class of 1936), has strengths in several areas: medieval
                    manuscripts and early printed books, especially those printed before 1500; early
                    printed Bibles; selected monuments of English literature; Americana (especially
                    early printed books relating to the New World); landmarks in the history of
                    ideas; and music. Treasures from several of these categories are gathered in
                    this portion of the Princeton University Digital Library.</p>

                <p>Beginning in 1723, the French artist Jean-Baptiste Massé (1687-1767) undertook
                    the task of copying Charles Le Brun’s Versailles ceiling decoration in the
                    Galerie des Glaces (Hall of Mirrors) and accompanying rooms, for the purpose of
                    making a series of reproductive engravings. Massé was given special permission
                    to build scaffolding in the galleries and spent over eight years at the ceiling
                    carefully reproducing Le Brun’s designs. A number of engravers worked over
                    twenty years to carve and then, print the series of plates. Completed in 1752,
                    La grande galerie de Versailles et les deux salons qui l’accompagnent was
                    published with 56 massive engravings on 52 plates. Princeton University Library
                    is fortunate to hold most of the set. For an extended reading of these and the
                    other scenes in the Hall of Mirrors, see also

                <p>The Graphic Arts Collection holds a number of unbound prints originally part of
                    the Cabinet du roi, created under Louis XIV to document and promote the cultural
                    activities of France. They include 18 of the 20 plates illustrating the 1676
                    Description de la grotte de Versailles, chiefly engraved by Jean Le Pautre
                    (1618-1682). Captioned in French and Latin, these plates represent an
                    architectural grotto built in 1666 adjacent to the palace, with particular
                    iconography of sea-nymphs, tritons and the sun-god. The name of the architect of
                    the grotto is not certainly known although Charles Perrault claimed that it was
                    designed by himself and his brother Claude. The sculptors named on the plates
                    are Gerard van Opstal, François Girardon, Thomas Regnaudin, Gaspar et Balthasar
                    de Marsy, Gilles Guérin and Jean-Baptiste Tuby. After the destruction of the
                    grotto in 1684 the statuary was relocated to other parts of the gardens.</p>

                <p>In the spring of 2015, the exhibition Versailles on Paper: A Graphic Panorama of
                    the Palace and Gardens of Louis XIV, which coincides with the tercentenary of
                    the death of Louis XIV (1638-1715), will bring together the finest holdings of
                    Firestone and Marquand Libraries documenting the development of Versailles
                    during the reign of the “Sun King.” In conjunction with the books and prints on
                    display, we have digitized several remarkable and in some cases unique volumes
                    from our collections for researchers worldwide. Additional single images will be
                    available on the exhibition website.</p>

                <p>The private manuscript libraries of Yemen, estimated at 50,000 codices,
                    constitutes the largest and most important set of unexamined Arabic manuscripts
                    in the world today. The Yemeni Manuscript Digitization Initiative presents, for
                    the first time, access to manuscripts from three private libraries in Sanaa,
                    Yemen, and virtually conjoins them to additional Yemeni manuscripts held by the
                    Princeton University Library and Staatsbibliothek, Berlin. The texts in this
                    archive were composed, copied, studied, and preserved by Zaydi scholars from the
                    tenth century to the present. Zaydism is a leading school of Islam in Northern
                    Yemen known for forms of rationalist theology that were abandoned in other
                    regions. The Yemeni Manuscript Digitization Initiative is made possible by a
                    Enriching Digital Collections Grant from the National Endowment for the
                    Humanities (NEH) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG). The grant is
                    administered by Princeton University Library and the Free University, Berlin in
                    conjunction with a Yemeni NGO. Information on this grant and related projects to
                    preserve and disseminate the manuscripts of Yemen can be found at
                    ymdi.uoregon.edu.</p>
